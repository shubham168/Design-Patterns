# Factory pattern

   ` Define an interface for creating an object, but let subclasses decide which class to instantiate.Factory method lets a class defer instantation to the subclasses.`

Factory pattern is creational pattern. Used for encapsulating object creation. In Factory pattern, we create object without exposing the creation logic to the client and refer to newly created object using a common interface.
